# kairos-client

### To launch the project, follow these steps:
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the root folder of the project.
2. Run the command `npm i` to install all the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the command `expo run:[ios|android]` to start the development server. (You may encounter crashes if you continue to use "npm start" or "expo start" to launch the app in the Expo App.)

This is a React Native app built using Expo SDK48 and the **Zustand ðŸ¥³** to manage state.
Due to a bug causing the Expo app to freeze when the Datetimepicker and modal appear simultaneously, we have made the decision to utilize "expo prebuild" and introduce components using customized code. \

### The app's code is structured as follows:

1. All the code for the app is contained within the `./src` folder.
2. The `./src/components` folder contains customized components that can be reused throughout the app.
3. The `./src/screens` folder contains all the screens in the app, excluding navigators.
5. Navigators are in `.src/navigator`
